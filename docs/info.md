## How it works

This is a standalone 8-bit UART transmitter. It takes a byte on the 8 input pins and sends it out on one pin as a
standard UART frame: 8N1, meaning 1 start bit, 8 data bits (LSB first), no parity, and 1 stop bit.

- **Clock:** 10 MHz. **Baud rate:** 9600, set by an 11-bit baud counter that divides by 1042. The baud error is 0.03%.
- **Control FSM:** four states: IDLE, START, DATA, STOP.
- **Data path:** an 8-bit shift register is loaded from `ui_in` when SEND rises, then shifted out one bit per baud tick.
  A 3-bit counter tracks the data bits.
- **SEND input:** passes through a two-flop synchronizer and a rising-edge detector. A SEND that arrives while a frame
  is in progress is ignored.

One frame takes 10 bit periods, about 1.04 ms.

## How to test

1. Set the project clock to 10 MHz and reset the design. TX (`uo[0]`) idles high and READY (`uo[2]`) is high.
2. Put a byte on `ui[7:0]` (for example 0x41, `A`).
3. Pulse `uio[0]` (SEND) high, then low. BUSY (`uo[1]`) goes high for about 1.04 ms while the frame is sent.
4. Connect `uo[0]` to the RX pin of a 3.3 V USB-UART adapter (FTDI, CP2102, CH340) and open a terminal at
   9600 baud, 8N1. You should see the character arrive.

### Clock accuracy

The baud rate is the project clock divided by 1042, so any clock error becomes the same baud error. A UART link
usually tolerates about 2% in total. On the demo board, the project clock is divided down from the RP2040 system
clock. A 125 MHz system clock cannot produce exactly 10 MHz (125 / 12 = 10.42 MHz, 125 / 13 = 9.62 MHz), which would
give a baud rate about 4% off and garbled characters. Check the clock frequency the board reports. If it is not
10.00 MHz, first set the RP2040 system clock to a multiple of 10 MHz, for example `machine.freq(120_000_000)`.

### Data hold time

SEND passes through a synchronizer, so the byte on `ui[7:0]` is captured 2 to 3 clock cycles after SEND rises. Set
the data first, then raise SEND, and keep the data unchanged until BUSY (`uo[1]`) goes high.

### Using an Arduino

An Arduino can receive instead of a USB-UART adapter: connect `uo[0]` to its RX pin (for example `Serial1.begin(9600)`
or SoftwareSerial) and GND to GND, then print what it receives. The chip only drives this line, so a 5 V Arduino
reads the 3.3 V signal directly. Never connect an Arduino output, such as a 5 V TX pin, to the chip's pins without a
level shifter.

## External hardware

A 3.3 V USB-to-UART adapter (FTDI or similar) or an Arduino, connected to TX (`uo[0]`) and GND.
